					'We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,' said Lord
					Canterville, 'since my grand-aunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was
					frightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two
					skeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for
					dinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has
					been seen by several living members of my family, as well as by the
					rector of the parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a Fellow of
					King's College, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the
					Duchess, none of our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady
					Canterville often got very little sleep at night, in consequence of
					the mysterious noises that came from the corridor and the library.'
